## About the Video Course
Advanced Data Mining Projects with R takes you one step ahead in understanding the most complex data mining algorithms and implementing them in the popular R language. Follow up to our course Data Mining Projects in R, this course will teach you how to build your own recommendation engine. You will also implement dimensionality reduction and use it to build a real-world project. Going ahead, you will be introduced to the concept of neural networks and learn how to apply them for predictions, classifications, and forecasting. Finally, you will implement ggplot2, plotly and aspects of geomapping to create your own data visualization projects.By the end of this course, you will be well-versed with all the advanced data mining techniques and how to implement them using R, in any real-world scenario.
